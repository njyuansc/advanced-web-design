# Ziger/Snead Redesign

## Why redesign?
* [Ziger/Snead](http://www.zigersnead.com/) is a Baltimore local architecture studio with a national reputation for design excellence. However, their website doesn't look as satisfied as their architecture achievement. It doesn't well-consider about user experience and accessibility. For example, the homepage of Ziger/Snead makes me very confused about what does the company do? Due to it only demonstrates an architecture background and a navigation bar, it not looks professional and sophisticated in the design field.  I'd like to redesign the website and optimise the user experience, which can give a better impression to clients and cooperative partners.

## Design content
